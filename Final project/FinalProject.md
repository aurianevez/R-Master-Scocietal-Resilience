# Final project   

The aim of this assignment was to retrieve data and then conduct a research.

We used a tweeter corpus retrived at the address: https://zenodo.org/record/4056563#.X_LpA9hKjD4. The paper explianing the methods of collection of the data
can be downloaded at this adress: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00596.pdf .

Our research question was the following: **How did the discourse of #BlackLivesMatter on twitter evolved after the murder of Georges Floyd?**

A full description of the project can be found in the introduction of the paper. 

We conducted a **Topic Modelling** mixed with **qualitative research method** in order to give more context and explaination of the results obtained by the **LDA**.  
In order to compare the evolution, we conducted two topic modeling and a data set containing tweets before the murder of George Floyd and a data set
containing tweet from the murder of Gerorge Floyd. 
A full description of the method can be found in the method section of the paper. 

**Those results needs to be considered as provisional. Indeed, the two authors of this paper are white woman. We intended to conduct interview with people of color
in order to verify our analysis and understanding of the results. Indeed, one of the main objectives of this study was to highlight the voice of the Black community,
hence without their input the results cannot be considered as conclusive and complete. Secondly, even when actively attempting to avoid bias, it would be inapropriate
to consider ourselves bias free!**
